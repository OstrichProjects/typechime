		<p>typeChi.me was created by <a href="http://jonost.me" target="_blank">Jonathan Ostrander</a> and Jonathon Schad at HackRPI in Fall 2014.</p>
		<p>-Generating notes: TypeChi.me reads in each word and breaks it down into its phonetic parts. The vowel sounds of the word are translated into relative tones according to the vowel&#39;s pitch when it is spoken<sup><a href="http://thelisteningmachine.org/about" title="The Listening Machine">1</a></sup>. This corresponds to a note relative to the current key of the program.</p>
		<p>-Tempo: Each note is put onto the note queue that plays a quarter note when a note is taken off the queue. Rests are added once a new word is started to break up the stream of notes. The beats per minute of the music is dynamically based on how fast you type so that the music keeps up with what you are typing.</p>
		<p>-Key: A major or minor key is assigned to the music based on the semantics of the words currently being used. Each adjective, noun, verb, and adverb has a positive, negative, and neutral value generated by a naive Bayes classfier trained using movie reviews<sup><a href="http://streamhacker.com/2010/05/10/text-classification-sentiment-analysis-naive-bayes-classifier/" title="Text Classification with nltk">2</a></sup>.  In order to determine which key the program is in, we use a moving average of the last 5 words. Different ranges of positive, negative, and neutral values correspond to different musical keys (for example, a positive rating greater than 0.66 yields Dmaj and a negative rating greater than 0.66 yields Fmin).</p>
		<p>-Chords: Background chords are generated on top of the main melody to add depth. A canon chord progression of 8 cords is continually repeated. When the user finishes a word, the program uses a Euclidean Rhythm algorithm to determine if it should play the next chord<sup><a href="http://blog.fader.co.uk/post/11519018856/bjorklund-algorithm-and-euclidean-rhythms" title="Generating Rhythms with Euclids GCD Algorithm">3</a></sup>.</p>
